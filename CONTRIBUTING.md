I am open to your input and want to make contributing to Gandalf easy and transparent. Please feel free to:

## Development with Github

I use GitHub to host code, track issues, and review pull requests.

## Using [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to Gandalf.

1. Fork the repo, create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!
