# Gandalf MCP Rules

**Core Principle:** Gather context before making changes. When unsure or working on complex tasks, use available tools to build understanding.

## When to Use MCP Tools

**Always use for:**
- Understanding unfamiliar codebases or projects
- Complex refactoring or architectural changes
- Debugging issues without clear root cause
- Building on previous work or established patterns

**Use when helpful:**
- Writing documentation or explanations
- Making decisions that affect multiple files/components
- Reviewing or validating approach before implementation

**Never execute, unless explicitly told to do so by the user:**
- git commands that alter state
- commands that alter files outside of the project root

## Priority Order

1. **Quick context first:** `get_project_info` and `get_git_status` for project state
2. **Search existing work:** `list_conversations` to find related past auto-sessions
3. **Deep dive when needed:** `get_conversation_context` for specific context

## Available Tools

- `get_project_info` - Project metadata, Git info, and file statistics
- `get_git_status` - Current repository state and pending changes  
- `list_conversations` - Find past relevant auto-sessions and decisions
- `get_conversation_context` - Detailed context from specific auto-sessions
- `list_project_files` - Discover project structure and componentsk
