# Gandalf

Gandalf is a Model Context Protocol for intelligent code assistance for your projects in Cursor. In the Lord of the Rings, Gandalf is a powerful wizard, but he is not omnipotent. He can see much, but there's only so much an maiar can do; that's where we mortals come in.

In the Lord of the Rings, Gandalf the Grey is a powerful wizard, but even he cannot see all ends. _"All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us."_ That's where we mortals come in - by providing Gandalf with the right context, we help him illuminate the path forward.

Although model dependent, with Gandalf we can provide a more comprehensive context to the AI assistant, allowing it to make more informed decisions and provide more accurate and helpful responses. Test it out with some complex commands and watch the conversation window show it use the tool calls to get incredible details and learn from its mistakes.

## What is a Model Context Protocol (MCP)?

"The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context and tools to LLMs. Think of MCP as a plugin system for Cursor - it allows you to extend the Agent's capabilities by connecting it to various data sources and tools through standardized interfaces." - [Source](https://www.cursor.com/blog/mcp-model-context-protocol)

## Key Features

- Smart Context Selection: Related files based on imports and dependencies
- Cursor Integration: Aware of current editing location, recent edits, and import relationships.
- Git Integration: Tracks repository status and changes
- Background Caching: Fast startup with persistent file caching
- Comprehensive Conversation Logging: Complete JSON-RPC protocol visibility
- Manual Conversation Storage: Explicit conversation saving for important dialogue
- Cursor Chat Extraction: Direct access to all your Cursor IDE conversations and chat history
- Allows fine tuning of context based on the current project and conversation history through weighting and filtering.

## ðŸ†• Cursor Chat Extraction

### **Automated Chat Export**

- **Direct database access** to Cursor's SQLite chat storage
- **Multi-workspace support** - automatically finds all your Cursor workspaces
- **Complete conversation history** - conversations, user messages, and AI responses
- **Multiple export formats** - JSON, Markdown, and Cursor-native format

### **Available Extraction Tools**

- `query_cursor_conversations` - Query conversations from Cursor IDE databases for AI context analysis
- `list_cursor_workspaces` - List available workspace databases

### **Use Cases**

- **Backup your conversations** before major Cursor updates
- **Analyze conversation patterns** and coding assistance trends
- **Export specific conversations** for documentation or sharing
- **Cross-reference past solutions** with current problems
- **Create searchable archives** of your AI-assisted development sessions

**Example Usage:**

```bash
# Get summary of all conversations
python3 gandalf/src/utils/cursor_chat_query.py --summary

# Export all conversations to markdown
python3 gandalf/src/utils/cursor_chat_query.py --format markdown --output my_conversations.md

# List available workspaces
python3 gandalf/src/utils/cursor_chat_query.py --list-workspaces
```

**Technical Details:**

- Works by reading Cursor's SQLite databases at `~/Library/Application Support/Cursor/User/`
- Extracts data from multiple database keys: `composer.composerData`, `aiService.prompts`, `aiService.generations`
- Fully tested with comprehensive error handling for missing or corrupted databases
- **No modification** of Cursor's data - read-only access only

## Prerequisites

Gandalf requires the following dependencies:

- **Python 3.10+**: Required for the MCP server
- **Git**: Required for repository operations and context intelligence
- **PyYAML** (optional): For dynamic weights configuration - if not available, falls back to environment variables and defaults
- **System Tools**: `jq` and `bats` (for testing and analysis)

## Platform Support

### **macOS & Linux: Full Support**

Gandalf has comprehensive support for macOS and Linux systems with native installation and management scripts.

### **Windows: Not Supported**

Gandalf requires bash and Unix tools. Windows users should use WSL2 for full compatibility.

### Python Dependencies

Gandalf can optionally use PyYAML for its dynamic configuration system that allows you to tune AI behavior through the `weights.yaml` file. If PyYAML is not available, the system will fall back to environment variables and built-in defaults.

### Dependency Checking

Check your environment with the cross-platform dependency checker:

```bash
# Quick dependency check
./gandalf.sh deps

# Detailed environment information
./gandalf.sh deps --verbose

# Attempt automatic installation (with confirmation)
./gandalf.sh deps --install
```

The dependency checker provides platform-specific installation instructions for:

- **macOS**: Homebrew installation commands
- **Linux**: Package manager detection (apt, yum, dnf, pacman, etc.)
- **Windows**: Use WSL2

### Environment Setup

For Python package management, you can optionally install PyYAML:

```bash
# Install PyYAML for dynamic configuration (optional)
pip install PyYAML>=6.0
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Check dependencies first
gandalf deps

# Install and configure
gandalf install

# Run tests to verify
gandalf test

# For global access, add alias:
alias gdlf='/path/to/gandalf/gandalf.sh'
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- Git repository
- Cursor with MCP support

## Available Tools

**File Operations:**

- `list_project_files` - Lists files with intelligent relevance scoring
- `get_project_info` - Project metadata and git information

**Conversation Analysis Tools:**

- `ingest_conversations` - Analyze and ingest relevant conversations from Cursor IDE history with intelligent caching
- `query_conversation_context` - Search conversations for specific topics, keywords, or context

**Cursor IDE Integration:**

- `query_cursor_conversations` - Query conversations from Cursor IDE databases for AI context analysis
- `list_cursor_workspaces` - List available Cursor workspace databases

## CLI Alias

For faster typing, add this alias to your shell profile (`.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, etc.):

```bash
alias gdlf='/path/to/gandalf/gandalf.sh'
```

### Dependency Management

The `deps` command provides comprehensive dependency checking:

```bash
# Check all dependencies
gandalf deps

# Check specific components
gandalf deps --python-only      # Python requirements only
gandalf deps --bats-only        # BATS testing framework only  
gandalf deps --core-only        # Core dependencies (Python, Git)

# Interactive installation assistance
gandalf deps --install          # Offers to help install missing deps

# Quiet mode for scripts
gandalf deps --quiet             # Exit codes only, minimal output
```

**Automatic Integration:**
- `gandalf install` automatically checks core dependencies before installation
- `gandalf test` verifies BATS and Python requirements before running tests
- `gandalf lembas` includes full dependency validation in its workflow

## Usage Recommendations

### When to Use Gandalf

**Best for extended, complex conversations:**

- Multi-file refactoring projects
- Architecture decisions requiring project context
- Debugging complex issues across multiple files
- Learning new codebases with thinking models like Claude Sonnet
- Long conversations where context accumulates value

**Gandalf's caching and context intelligence systems provide significant benefits for:**

- **Thinking models** (Claude Sonnet, etc.) that benefit from rich context
- **Extended sessions** where file relationships and conversation history matter
- **Complex projects** with many interconnected files

### When to Use Standard Models

**For quick, isolated tasks:**

- Simple code snippets or single-file changes
- Quick questions that don't require project context
- Fast iteration on small problems
- When you prefer minimal overhead

**Non-thinking models without MCP may be faster for:**

- Single-purpose queries
- Code generation without project context
- Quick documentation lookups

The 1-hour cache TTL and context intelligence overhead are optimized for sustained, complex work rather than quick one-off interactions.

## How It Works

- **Project-Specific Installation**: Each project has its own Gandalf installation and configuration
- **Auto-Detection**: Detects project context from current working directory and git repository
- **Smart Caching**: 1-hour TTL with intelligent invalidation
- **Context Intelligence**: Multi-factor file scoring and prioritization

## Troubleshooting

1. **MCP Logs**: View â†’ Output â†’ MCP Logs (set to DEBUG level)
2. **Reset**: `gandalf install -r` for clean reinstall
3. **Restart**: Restart Cursor completely after config changes

## gandalf-rules.md

This is where you can lock or unlock Gandalf's power; it is automatically "installed" when you run `gandalf install`, or re-isntalled with `gandalf install -r`

## Troubleshooting

1. **To watch the logs within Cursor**: Go to `View` -> `Output` -> and select `MCP Logs` from the dropdown.

   Set the MCP Logs level to `DEBUG` or `INFO` to see detailed tool call activity. If you only see basic connection messages but not tool execution details, you're likely on `ERROR` level only. This can waste hours of debugging time thinking tools aren't working when they're just not logging at your current level.

   **Tip**: Click the cogwheel icon next to the MCP Logs dropdown and select "Set as Default" to make `DEBUG` your permanent default log level for all MCP servers.

2. **If changes to rules or configuration aren't taking effect**: Run `gandalf reset gandalf` followed by `gandalf install -f` to force a clean reinstall, then restart Cursor completely.
3. Opening `.mdc` files in Cursor while a conversation is active will majorly slow down your IDE. This appears to be a known bug.
4. The `claude-4-sonnet` thinking model yielded the best results for me; it very rarely failed to sufficiently respond to my queries and I almost never had to correct it.
5. For best results, turn on "auto-run" for your agent.
6. If throughout the duration of a chat you hit `stop`, or chat disconnects, and then trigger chat with a new conversation, it can sometimes read like the agent forgot the earlier context or will even ignore your new context. Fortunately with our caching system this includes _both_ older and latest messages and your agent _should_ pick handle all your messages. The order it manages them it will choose on its own.
7. The agent's are extremely sensitive to the rules set out in [./rules.md](./rules.md). If you change them, you will need to restart the server. More importantly, rules here can completely change how your agent interacts with the MCP; during my testing at one point it started committing any change it made without asking, and would remove files forcibly without checking with me.

## Notes

- Each of the README's in this project were generated _without_ AI. If any of them are unclear please ask me (Tristan) to clarify.
- Storing state of MCP tool calls has a wicked benefit of pseud-state management. You could ask the agent to modify a large number of files and have them in a pending commit state. If you then ask the agent to revert back to the original state before creating this changes it will know exactly where to return to _without_ needing git hashes as reference.

## TODO:

- Re-implement Python test suite using pytest; comprehensive testing framework was temporarily removed during code cleanup and needs to be restored with proper test coverage for all MCP tools and core functionality
- Implement persistent disk cache for cross-session performance; add cache warming on project initialization; smart cache invalidation based on file system events
- Improve scoring algorithm to better handle edge cases (very large files, binary files, etc.)
- Allow context intelligence to learn from user behavior and adjust weights automatically
- Improve file cache performance for large repositories (>10k files)
- Validate `weights.yaml` on startup and provide helpful error messages for invalid configs
- Add guided setup wizard for first-time users; maybe we use `dialog`
- Add command to show current server status, cache health, and configuration summary
- Add ability to send notifications to the IDE
- Automate the "Export Chat" feature of the chat window. This is hidden behind Cursor's API
