# Live Test Prompts for Conversations and Context Intelligence

This file contains test prompts you can send to verify that the conversation and context intelligence systems are working properly in a live environment. At the end of each test, grade and report the test input, expected behavior, actual behavior, time taken, and pass/fail status from an agent's perspective.

## üóÇÔ∏è Conversation System Tests

### Test 1: Basic Conversation Storage

**Prompt to send:**

```
Store this conversation with the title "Live Test Session" and tags "test,manual,verification". Make sure it creates the proper directory structure.
```

### Test 3: Project-Specific Conversation Filtering

**Prompt to send:**

```
What project name am I currently in? Show me how conversations are organized by project.
```

**Expected behavior:**

- Should identify current project name from project root

```

**Expected behavior:**

- Should recursively scan directory
- Should filter to loadable file types (.json, .txt, .log, .md)
- Should truncate at 5 files if more exist
- Should show file-specific handling for each type

### Test 7: Conversation Format Detection

**Prompt to send:**

```
Create a JSON file that looks like conversation data and load it with the generic content loader. Show me how it detects conversation format.
```

**Expected behavior:**

- Should detect JSON arrays with conversation-like structure
- Should identify when data contains 'messages' fields
- Should format conversation data appropriately
- Should show message counts and titles

### Test 8: History Data Loading

**Prompt to send:**

```
Load some context from the ~/.gandalf/history directory to show how old data can be side-loaded for context.
```

**Expected behavior:**

- Should successfully load data from history directory
- Should handle various file formats in backup
- Should provide useful context formatting
- Should not affect current conversation storage

## üîß MCP Server Integration Tests

### Test 9: MCP Tools Availability

**Prompt to send:**

```
What MCP tools do you have available for conversation and context management? List them and their capabilities.
```

**Expected behavior:**

- Should list conversation-related MCP tools
- Should include `store_conversation`, `list_conversations`, `get_conversation_context`
- Should mention project root parameter passing
- Should explain auto-store functionality

### Test 10: Project Context Gathering

**Prompt to send:**

```
Gather context about this project using your MCP tools. Show me project info, git status, and recent conversations.
```

**Expected behavior:**

- Should use `get_project_info` to get project metadata
- Should use `get_git_status` for repository state
- Should use `list_conversations` for recent conversation history
- Should combine information coherently

### Test 11: File System Operations

**Prompt to send:**

```
Show me the current project structure and search for any conversation-related files or directories.
```

**Expected behavior:**

- Should use `list_project_files` or similar tools
- Should identify conversation directories
- Should show proper file organization
- Should find conversation.json and messages.json files

## üìä Advanced Integration Tests

### Test 12: Cross-Project Conversation Isolation

**Prompt to send:**

```
Explain how conversations are isolated between different projects and demonstrate the project_name filtering.
```

**Expected behavior:**

- Should explain project_name field usage
- Should show how conversations are filtered by project
- Should demonstrate isolation between projects
- Should explain directory structure benefits

### Test 13: Large Content Handling

**Prompt to send:**

```
Create and load a large JSON file to test content truncation and handling of oversized data.
```

**Expected behavior:**

- Should handle large files gracefully
- Should truncate content at appropriate limits (500 chars for JSON)
- Should indicate truncation with "..."
- Should not crash or hang

### Test 14: Error Handling

**Prompt to send:**

```
Test error handling by trying to load non-existent files and malformed JSON data.
```

**Expected behavior:**

- Should handle missing files gracefully
- Should return appropriate error messages
- Should handle malformed JSON without crashing
- Should provide useful debugging information

### Test 15: Unicode and Special Characters

**Prompt to send:**

```
Test Unicode handling by creating and loading files with special characters, emojis, and international text.
```

**Expected behavior:**

- Should handle UTF-8 encoding properly
- Should display special characters correctly
- Should not have encoding errors
- Should preserve character integrity

## üöÄ Performance and Reliability Tests

### Test 16: Conversation Directory Structure Performance

```

**Expected behavior:**

- Should create unique directories for each conversation
- Should handle concurrent conversation creation
- Should maintain proper metadata separation
- Should not have file conflicts

### Test 17: Memory and Resource Usage

**Prompt to send:**

```
Load a directory with many files and verify memory usage stays reasonable with truncation limits.
```

- Should not load entire large files into memory
- Should use streaming/chunked reading where appropriate
- Should be responsive with large datasets

### Test 18: Backup and History Integration

- Should verify constants are used throughout the system
- Should show other relevant configuration values
- Should explain configuration flexibility

### Test 20: End-to-End Workflow

```

**Expected behavior:**

- Should execute full workflow seamlessly
- Should demonstrate all systems working together
- Should show proper data flow between components
- Should confirm system integration
